- so that I don't need to pay per token using APIs, I'll create a local LLM
- choosing LM Studio over Ollama because the UI is much better
- will choose Mistral 7B for my model ... reasoning below:
    (1) DeepSeek R1 Distilled (Qwen 7B): great at reasoning tasks, very efficient, trained by DeepSeek
            - Best for structured reasoning, math, and basic chatbot tasks.
    (2) Mistral 7B: great general purpose open source model, good at nlp/reasoning/generation
            - Best for chatbots, summarization, text generation, and reasoning
    (3) Gemma 7B: safety aligned for better response reliability but good at general conversation
            - Best for safe, high-quality conversations and Q&A tasks.
